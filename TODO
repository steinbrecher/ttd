Ideas for future work:

* Write MATLAB .mex wrappers. 
  Would probably be best accomplished by compiling the g^(2) code as a shared
  library and then linking it to a bare-bones .mex implementation. 

* Convert API (esp. variables for filenames, buffers, etc.) to be universally
  zero-indexed.

* Write to .mat and/or .h5 files rather than CSV

* Output channel markers as .ttd files

* Split output (both of correlation programs and of conversion programs) on 
  markers
