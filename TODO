Ideas for future work:

* Write MATLAB .mex wrappers. 
  Would probably be best accomplished by compiling the g^(2) code as a shared
  library and then linking it to a bare-bones .mex implementation. 

* Fix edge errors for g2 correlations. Probably need to extend window by 1 bin 
  and drop first/last bins before output.

* Output timing information in g3 correlations
