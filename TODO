Ideas for future work:

* Write MATLAB .mex wrappers. 
  Would probably be best accomplished by compiling the g^(2) code as a shared
  library and then linking it to a bare-bones .mex implementation. 

* Fix edge errors for g2 correlations. Probably need to extend window by 1 bin 
  and drop first/last bins before output.

* Calculate all orders of correlations between input files and output to CSV,
  so that we don't have to run through the files so many times

* Write a filebuffer group to handle getting next photon from multiple channels

* Convert API (esp. variables for filenames, buffers, etc.) to be universally
  zero-indexed.

* Write to .mat and/or .h5 files rather than CSV

* Run correlations directly on picoquant files rather than requiring conversion
  to .ttd (halfway done, need to finish pq_filebuffer)

* Output channel markers as .ttd files

* Split output (both of correlation programs and of conversion programs) on 
  markers
