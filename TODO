Ideas for future work:

* Convert handling of time from a double to a 64-bit integer (in picoseconds).
  2^64 picoseconds is ~213 days so this wouldn't be a practical limit in terms
  of integration time. 

* Support PicoHarp files.
  Probably want to separate the file interface from the g^(2) or other 
  data processing code. 
  I think there are two file format versions of interest here -- need to get
  the full specifications for those. 

* Write MATLAB .mex wrappers. 
  Would probably be best accomplished by compiling the g^(2) code as a shared
  library and then linking it to a bare-bones .mex implementation.
